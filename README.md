# Bachelor-Thesis
his thesis introduces \emph{Katalog}, a hybrid mobile–web application designed to digitize and streamline the workflow of special–education schools by replacing paper-based records with a centralized digital system. The application enables teachers and therapists to manage student profiles, record anthropometric measurements, capture posture images, and compute key angles (shoulder\_tilt, hip\_tilt, and spine\_tilt) using an AI module based on BlazePose. By integrating this functionality into a React Native frontend and a Node.js/PostgreSQL backend, \emph{Katalog} simplifies data entry and retrieval while ensuring consistency and security.

The core contribution lies in embedding an AI-driven posture analysis into a lightweight mobile interface tailored for educators with limited technical expertise. A transparent grid overlay and real-time keypoint detection provide immediate visual feedback, reducing assessment time by approximately 40\% compared to manual methods. An original threshold of 15° deviation was defined based on pilot tests, allowing users to identify significant postural abnormalities at a glance. The system’s architecture follows a clear three-tier design, with RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations and a dedicated service for on-server AI inference.

In addition to improving efficiency and accuracy, \emph{Katalog} offers a simple interface for viewing and deleting historical posture images, displaying computed angles alongside each photo. Future work envisions enhancing the AI module to detect spinal segments (cervical, thoracic, lumbar) and compute region-specific deviations, implementing real-time video analysis, and extending support for IoT posture sensors. Overall, this work provides a novel, user-friendly solution for tele-rehabilitation and classroom surveillance in special–education settings, bridging the gap between traditional practices and modern digital tools.
